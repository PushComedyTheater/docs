# Basic terminology

There was an attempt to keep as much of the nomenclature as possible from our previous incarnation.  However, now is a good time to go over some of the terminology of our application.

We have two types of objects that we sell tickets for - **events** and **classes**.  Everything on our site comes from one of those types.  

**Events** have many **listings** associated with them.  For example, we have an event called *"Who Dunnit? ... The Improvised Murder Mystery"*.  This event happens every month and we sell tickets to those individual occurrences of this show called **listings**.  

Likewise, we have **classes** listed on our site.  These **classes** have **listings** which are the individual instances of a class.  For example, *Improv 101* is a **class** that we offer and it has a **listing** offered from March 4 - April 8th.
